// Write a function called even(), which receives an array containing numbers as a parameter.
// The function returns a second (usually smaller) array which has the even
// numbers of the original array. The function must not make changes to the original table. (3p)
// Example: In a three-item array, there are items 2, 7 and 4. The function returns a two-item array with items 2 and 4.
// Print both the original array and the new array to the console in the main program after you have called the function.
// You can hardcode the array, no need for prompt().

const numarray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

  let evennumbers = []
  for (i = 0; i<array.length; i++){

    }
